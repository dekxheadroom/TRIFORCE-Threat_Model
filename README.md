## Purpose

TRIFORCE is a heuristic model for Threat-Informed Defence, enabling security operators to formulate probable threat courses of action for simulation of attack and defence, so as to validate and fine-tune current security posture. It's designed for **Purple Teams defending systems already in production**, offering a quick, dirty yet substantial approach, much like a good bowl of Jiro Ramen.

## Why TRIFORCE? (The Impetus)

Many existing threat models are primarily designed for strategic risk management or system development phases, often lacking an action-oriented focus on specific threat actors in live environments. TRIFORCE fills this critical gap by:

* **Focusing on Probable Threats:** Moving beyond generic possibilities to prioritise actual, identified threat actors.
* **Actionable Simulation:** Providing a framework for developing practical simulation exercises to validate and fine-tune your security posture.
* **Comprehensive Perspective:** Integrating technical vulnerabilities with crucial human behavioural interactions and organisational patterns of life.

## Core Concept

At its heart, TRIFORCE operates on the axiom:

**Threat = (Intent x Capability x Opportunity) / Security Posture**

This model drives defense by assuming the Attacker's Perspective to find paths through defender's infrastructure, leveraging both technical and non-technical assets. It builds Threat Courses of Action (TCoAs) using the Cyber Kill Chain and culminates in attack and defense simulations.

## Key Outcomes

* Understand if your security posture is sufficient to deter, delay or disrupt attacks from identified threat actors.
* Reduce your attack surface area effectively.
* Proactively observe, detect, and decisively respond to threat activities.
